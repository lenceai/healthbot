What began as a small social experiment soon transformed into a global platform, connecting billions of people across the world. Over the years, it expanded beyond profiles and friend requests, introducing features like the News Feed, Messenger, and Marketplace. Deep learning and neural networks have revolutionized artificial intelligence, enabling machines to learn complex patterns from data. Machine learning algorithms process vast amounts of information to make predictions and automate decision-making processes."
